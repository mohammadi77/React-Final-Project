React-Final-Project

Movie search site
1- We need a vpn for the site to be able to get information
2- I tried to do all the requested things and in addition to that I did other things (hover for cards - it takes all the pictures of the actors and displays them as a slider - there are 6 gallery pictures for each movie - actors who do not have pictures get pictures depending on their gender - movies and series that do not have pictures get pictures of no availble - in the search box, in addition to enter, a more button was placed in them and ...)
3- The genre page takes a while to receive and sort the information. Please wait until the page loads and the information is fully received.
